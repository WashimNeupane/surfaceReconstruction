# Surface Reconstruction:
Undergraduate Research project in surface reconstruction of plant models based on 3D point cloud scanner data using MATLAB. 

To understand the scope of this project, view the reconstructio.pptx file which provides a detailled explaination. 

This is only intended as a demo so insted of using the actual dataset I worked with, i have only included a small subset of it saved as .mat workspace. This allows us to skip over all of the pre-processing steps and directly go to surface reconstruction methods.
